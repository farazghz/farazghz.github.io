Thank you for visiting! I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Corporate Entrepreneurship from the University of Tehran and am deeply passionate about the future of human resource management and organizational behavior. As a Graduate Researcher at the Behavioral Research Lab and a Research and Teaching Assistant at the University of Tehran, my focus is on exploring how human behavior and interactions shape the workplace.

Through my research, I aim to bridge the gap between academic theories and practical solutions. I have led various projects that develop cognitive assessment tools for HR performance appraisals, utilizing innovative analytical tools like R, Python, SPSS, Stata, and SmartPLS. My ultimate goal is to contribute to making workplaces more human-centered, effective, and fulfilling.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you!
