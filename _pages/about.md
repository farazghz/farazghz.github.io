Thank you for visiting! I am a Graduate Researcher at the Convergent Technologies Research Center (NBIC) and a Teaching Assistant at the University of Tehran, where I specialize in organizational behavior, creativity, and decision-making. I hold a Master's degree in Corporate Entrepreneurship, where my thesis explored the impact of monetary rewards on employee innovation through a cognitive neuroscience lens.

  My research focuses on the intersection of behavioral science and management, with an emphasis on reward systems, neurodiversity, and executive functions. I have led projects developing cognitive assessment tools for HR performance appraisals and have supervised several research initiatives, utilizing tools like R, Python, and SmartPLS. My work aims to bridge academic theory with practical applications to enhance organizational outcomes.
